                <h1>What is C++</h1>
                <article>C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup
                    as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded
                    significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in
                    addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a
                    compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation,
                    LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[9]

                    C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained
                    software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design
                    highlights.[10] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being
                    software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications,
                    video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical
                    applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[11]

                    C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                    standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally
                    known as C++20).[12] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC
                    14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current
                    C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the
                    initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at
                    Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language
                    similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.[13] Since 2012, C++
                    has been on a three-year release schedule[14] with C++23 as the next planned standard.[15]</p>
                    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                    <li>It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world
                        programs.</li>
                    <li>Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).</li>
                    <li>Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully
                        supported by C++.</li>
                    <li>Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++.</li>
                    <li>It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and
                        provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.</li>
                    <li>No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those
                        explicitly requested by the programmer).</li>
                    <li>User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types.</li>
                    <li>Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance).
                    </li>
                    <li>There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language).</li>
                    <li>C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own
                        separate and incompatible programming environment.</li>
                    <li>If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual
                        control.</li>

                <h1> Objects and Classes</h1>
                <article>Class: A class in C++ is the building block, that leads to Object-Oriented programming. It is a
                    user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed
                    and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
                    For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but
                    all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit,
                    Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.

                    A Class is a user defined data-type which has data members and member functions.
                    Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these
                    variables and together these data members and member functions defines the properties and behavior
                    of the objects in a Class.
                    In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc and member
                    functions can be apply brakes, increase speed etc.
                    An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is
                    instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.</article>

                <h1>Inheritance</h1>
                <article> The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is
                    called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived
                    Class.
                    Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super
                    class.
                    The article is divided into following subtopics:

                    Why and when to use inheritance?
                    Modes of Inheritance
                    Types of Inheritance
                    Why and when to use inheritance?

                    Consider a group of vehicles. You need to create classes for Bus, Car and Truck. The methods
                    fuelAmount(), capacity(), applyBrakes() will be same for all of the three classes. If we create
                    these classes avoiding inheritance then we have to write all of these functions in each of the three
                    classes as shown in below figure:

                <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
                The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the
                ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a
                husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is
                called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented
                Programming.

                In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

                Compile time Polymorphism
                Runtime Polymorphism
                Compile time polymorphism: The overloaded functions are invoked by matching the type and number of
                arguments. This information is available at the compile time and, therefore, compiler selects the
                appropriate function at the compile time. It is achieved by function overloading and operator
                overloading which is also known as static binding or early binding. Now, let's consider the case where
                function name and prototype is same.
                When people talk about polymorphism in C++ they usually mean the thing of using a derived class through
                the base class pointer or reference, which is called subtype polymorphism. But they often forget that
                there are all kinds of other polymorphisms in C++, such as parametric polymorphism, ad-hoc polymorphism
                and coercion polymorphism.

                These polymorphisms also go by different names in C++,

                Subtype polymorphism is also known as runtime polymorphism.
                Parametric polymorphism is also known as compile-time polymorphism.
                Ad-hoc polymorphism is also known as overloading.
                Coercion is also known as (implicit or explicit) casting.
                In this article I'll illustrate all the polymorphisms through examples in C++ language and also give
                insight on why they have various other names.

                <h1>Abstraction</h1>
                <article> Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented
                    programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.
                    Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world,
                    hiding the background details or implementation.

                    Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                    accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not
                    know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the
                    inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what
                    abstraction is.

                    Abstraction using Classes: We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. Class helps us to
                    group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide which
                    data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.

                    Abstraction in Header files: One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example,
                    consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate power of a
                    number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as
                    arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually
                    calculating power of numbers.

                <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
                <article> In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the
                    methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's
                    components.[1] Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside
                    a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden
                    implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.

                    Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class to access or modify the state more
                    abstractly. In practice sometimes methods (so-called "getters" and "setters") are provided to access
                    the values indirectly, but, although not necessarily a violation of abstract encapsulation, they are
                    often considered a sign-post of potentially poor object-oriented programming (OOP) design practice
                    [2] (an Anti-pattern).

                    This mechanism is not unique to OOP. Implementations of abstract data types, e.g., modules, offer a
                    similar form of encapsulation. The similarity has been explained by programming language theorists
                    in terms of existential types.[3]
                    <h3>Concept of Encapsulation</h3>
                    <article>
                        Unable to deal with the complexity of an object, human chooses to ignore its non-essential
                        details and concentrate on the details which are essential to our understanding. You can place a
                        simple context of the object model, that abstraction is "looking for what you want" within an
                        object or class. But there is another major concept connected to abstraction which is called
                        encapsulation.

                        So basically, encapsulation can be defined as the process of hiding all of the details of an
                        object that do not throw in or dealt with its essential characteristics. Encapsulation can also
                        be defined as preventing access to non-essential details of classes or its objects. Abstraction
                        and encapsulation have close bonding among each other. Encapsulation assists abstraction by
                        providing a means of suppressing the non-essential details.
